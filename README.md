## About Me

### Introduction

- A Computer Geek.
- Have fun with computer things and Internet.
- Like to learn new tricks from Internet and implement them.
- Like to play Table Tennis.
- Believe in human readable code.
- Tend to write code that is more comforting to human eyes.

### Strengths

- Can get new ideas more rapidly than others.
- Only do work that is possible to complete within given time limit, If no option is there, then try my best to complete.
- In free time, Tend to do some productive work or do some new things.
- Can remember the database structure and code flow which is very helpful in debugging.

### Weaknesses

- Hate to code in hurry. But refactor it later on, as coding in hurry results to unpredictable results.

## Technical

### Programming Languages

Have learnt most of NodeJS technologies from udemy courses and most of the best practices from youtube. Technologies worked on are php, Java, JSP and NodeJS. Like to code with NodeJS but always eager to learn new technologies.

### Databases

Have worked with MySQL, Microsoft SQL and MongoDB till now, but looking forward to try others also.

### Best Practices

After learning syntax of new technologies, it is necessary to follow the best practice. Dont only follow the best practices, but also find the reason behind why is it a best practice and then follow it keeping in mind the reason.

### Coding Style

Whenever starting a new Project (or working on an existing project), defining the styling guide is always good and it keeps the codebase clean. Like to follow the styling guide (if any) or define the one based on the prject.

### Debugging

For any project, debugging is a must have skill. Can debug very well as I like to explore how the code works.
