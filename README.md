## About Me

### Introduction

I am a Computer Geek. I will be an Engineer soon. I have fun with computer things and Internet. I like to learn new tricks from Internet and implement them. I also like to play Table Tennis.

### Strengths

I can get new ideas more rapidly than others. I only do work that is possible to complete within given time limit, If no option is there, I try my best to complete. In my free time, I tend to do some productive work or do some new things.

### Weaknesses

I can work under pressure but a little less productive than I work when I am not. I need a little free time for getting fresh after some hard work. In that free time.
