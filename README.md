## About Me

### Introduction

I am a Computer Geek. I have fun with computer things and Internet. I like to learn new tricks from Internet and implement them. I also like to play Table Tennis. I believe in human readable code. I tend to write code that is more comforting to human eyes.

### Strengths

I can get new ideas more rapidly than others. I only do work that is possible to complete within given time limit, If no option is there, I try my best to complete. In my free time, I tend to do some productive work or do some new things. I can remember the database structure and code flow which is very helpful in debugging.

### Weaknesses

I hate to code in hurry. Though I refactor it later on, but coding in hurry results to unpredictable results which I like to avoid as much as possible.

## Technical

### Programming Languages

I have learnt most of NodeJStechnologies from udemy courses and most of the best practices from youtube. Technologies that I have worked on are php, Java, JSP and NodeJS. I like to code with NodeJS but always eager to learn new technologies.

### Databases

I have worked with MySQL, Microsoft SQL and MongoDB till now, but looking forward to try others also.

### Best Practices

After learning syntax of new technologies, it is necessary to follow the best practice. I dont only follow the best practices, but also find the reason behind why is it a best practice and then follow it keeping in mind the reason.

### Coding Style

Whenever starting a new Project (or working on an existing project), defining the styling guide is always good and it keeps the codebase clean. I like to follow the styling guide (if any) or define the one based on the prject.

### Debugging

For any project, debugging is a must have skill. I can debug very well as I like to explore how the code works.
